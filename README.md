# Sorting-Visualizer

Quicksort is a comparison sort, meaning that it can sort items of any type for which a "less-than" relation (formally, a total order) is defined.
Efficient implementations of Quicksort are not a stable sort, meaning that the relative order of equal sort items is not preserved.

This is a basic implementation of quick sort algorithm. The website visualizes quick sort algorithm when the elements are being sorted.
